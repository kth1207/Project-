            You can't call yourself a Korean cook without knowing the recipe for how to make what is arguably the most
            famous Korean dish - bulgogi. If you don't know what bulgogi is, you're in for a real treat.

            This most popular of Korean dishes includes thinly sliced meat that has a smoky-sweet flavor when broiled or
            cooked on the grill. Bulgogi is even delicious stir-fried, and the tender beef can be used in anything from
            Korean “sushi” rolls (kimbap) to stir-fried noodles (japchae, chapchae). Bulgogi is usually accompanied with
            lettuce wraps and spicy red pepper paste (kochujang) for wrapping and spicing up the meat.

            Of course, many Westerners can't handle much heat, so if you'd rather go without the red pepper paste, feel
            free to skip it, but know that it is delicious. If you can tolerate spices and don't have a medical
            condition, like an ulcer, that might make spicy food a bit risky for you, enjoy the meat along with the
            paste. To say that it is delectable would be an understatement. Now, on to the recipe.
