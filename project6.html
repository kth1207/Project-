            Korea’s national dish, kimchi, is a spicy, pickled cabbage that is served as a condiment with almost every
            meal. Kimchi stew (kimchi jjigae or kimchichigae) combines kimchi with other ingredients such as beef,
            onions, garlic, and tofu. It is meant to be eaten slowly, and it's served bubbling hot.

            Fiery, hearty, and full of flavor, kimchi jjigae (pronounced kim-chee GEE-jig-ee) is great for cold winter
            days, but Koreans can eat it anytime, anywhere. It's one of the most popular stews in Korea and is featured
            at many meals and in traditional restaurants. There's just one thing to keep in mind when you're planning to
            make kimchi jjigae—it is spicy. Really, really spicy. That's why it's served with a lot of white rice, to
            help balance out all that heat.
